# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how to get started.

## Quick Process

1. **Open an issue** first to discuss your idea
2. **Wait for approval** from maintainers
3. **Submit a PR** with your changes

This avoids wasted work on things we can't accept.

> **For new features:** Please open an issue for discussion before starting work. We want to make sure the feature aligns with the project direction.

## What to Include

**Bug reports:**

- What you expected vs what happened
- Steps to reproduce
- Your environment (OS, Node version)

**Feature proposals:**

- Problem it solves
- Your proposed solution
- Any breaking changes

## Best Practices

**Setup:**

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b my-feature`
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org):
   - `feat: add support for new agent`
   - `fix: resolve path resolution issue`
   - `docs: update README`
5. Push and open a PR

**Pull requests should:**

- Link to related issue
- Keep changes focused (one PR per issue)
- Follow existing code style
- Pass all CI checks
